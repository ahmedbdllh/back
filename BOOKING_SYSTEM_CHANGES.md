# Booking System Changes: Hide Booked Slots

## Overview
Changed the booking system to hide booked time slots entirely from players instead of showing them as red/disabled. Now players only see available time slots in green.

## Changes Made

### Backend Changes

#### 1. Team Booking API (`backend/service-booking/routes/teamBooking.js`)
- **Modified available slots endpoint**: Now only returns truly available slots
- **Updated response structure**: Removed `allSlots` property, only returns `availableSlots`
- **Simplified logic**: Uses `Booking.getAvailableSlots()` which filters out booked slots automatically
- **Updated conflict error message**: Better messaging for race conditions

#### 2. Individual Booking API (`backend/service-booking/routes/booking.js`)
- **Added new endpoint**: `/api/bookings/available-slots/:courtId` for individual bookings
- **Consistent behavior**: Same logic as team bookings - only available slots returned
- **Updated conflict error message**: Better messaging for race conditions

#### 3. Booking Model (`backend/service-booking/models/Booking.js`)
- **Existing method used**: `getAvailableSlots()` method already filters out booked slots
- **Consistent filtering**: Returns only time slots that don't conflict with existing bookings

### Frontend Changes

#### 1. Individual Booking Calendar (`front/src/features/booking/components/BookingCalendar.js`)
- **Updated API endpoint**: Now calls `/api/bookings/available-slots/:courtId`
- **Simplified slot rendering**: Removed all red/booked slot styling and logic
- **Clean UI**: Only shows available slots with hover effects and selection states
- **Removed imports**: Cleaned up unused XCircle import

#### 2. Team Booking Page (`front/src/features/booking/components/TeamBookingPage.js`)
- **Updated state management**: Removed `allSlots` state, only uses `availableSlots`
- **Simplified slot display**: Only shows available slots in green
- **Added empty state**: Shows message when no slots are available for selected date
- **Updated labeling**: "Available Time Slots (booked times are hidden)"

## User Experience Changes

### Before:
- Players saw all time slots (available in green, booked in red)
- Booked slots were disabled and showed booking details
- Red indicators for 7 PM, etc. when booked

### After:
- Players only see available time slots
- All visible slots are selectable (no disabled states)
- If 7 PM is booked, it simply doesn't appear in the list
- Clean, focused interface showing only bookable options

## Benefits

1. **Cleaner UI**: No visual clutter from unavailable options
2. **Better UX**: Players can't accidentally try to book unavailable slots
3. **Reduced Confusion**: No need to explain red/green color system
4. **Faster Selection**: Only relevant options are displayed
5. **Conflict Prevention**: Eliminates most booking conflicts at UI level

## Technical Details

- **Email notifications**: Still working as before for all bookings
- **Manager views**: Not affected - managers still see all booking data
- **Database**: No schema changes - filtering happens at query level
- **Performance**: Improved - fewer slots to render and process
- **Race conditions**: Still handled with improved error messages

## Files Modified

### Backend:
- `backend/service-booking/routes/teamBooking.js`
- `backend/service-booking/routes/booking.js`

### Frontend:
- `front/src/features/booking/components/BookingCalendar.js`
- `front/src/features/booking/components/TeamBookingPage.js`

## Testing Verification
