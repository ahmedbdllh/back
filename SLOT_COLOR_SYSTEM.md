# Slot Status Color System

## Overview
The booking system now displays time slots with color-coded status indicators to help players easily identify available and booked times.

## Color System

### üü¢ Green Slots (Available)
- **Color**: Green background with green border
- **Status**: Available for booking
- **Clickable**: ‚úÖ Yes
- **Shows**: Time range, duration, price
- **Behavior**: Can be selected for booking

### üî¥ Red Slots (Booked)
- **Color**: Red background with red border  
- **Status**: Already booked by another player/team
- **Clickable**: ‚ùå No (disabled)
- **Shows**: Time range, "Booked" text, team/player name
- **Behavior**: Cannot be selected, visual indicator only

### üîµ Blue Slots (Selected)
- **Color**: Blue background when selected
- **Status**: Currently selected by user
- **Shows**: Time range with checkmark icon
- **Behavior**: Ready for booking confirmation

## Implementation Details

### Backend Changes
1. **New Model Method**: `Booking.getAllSlotsWithStatus()` returns all time slots with booking status
2. **Enhanced APIs**: Both team booking and calendar APIs now return:
   - `availableSlots`: Only bookable slots (for booking logic)
   - `allSlots`: All slots with status (for UI display)

### Frontend Changes
1. **TeamBookingPage**: Displays color-coded slot grid with legend
2. **BookingCalendar**: Enhanced slot display with status indicators
3. **Dynamic Styling**: Conditional CSS classes based on slot status

## User Experience

### Before
- Players could only see available time slots
- No indication of which times were already taken
- Had to guess why certain times weren't showing

### After  
- ‚úÖ **Clear Visual Feedback**: Green = available, Red = booked
- ‚úÖ **Complete Schedule View**: See all time slots throughout the day
- ‚úÖ **Booking Information**: See who booked each slot
- ‚úÖ **Better Planning**: Players can see popular time patterns
- ‚úÖ **No Confusion**: No mystery about missing time slots

## Benefits

1. **Improved UX**: Players immediately understand slot availability
2. **Transparency**: Shows who has booked each slot
3. **Better Planning**: Players can see busy vs quiet periods
4. **Reduced Confusion**: No wondering why slots are missing
5. **Visual Appeal**: Color-coded interface is more engaging

## Technical Implementation

The system now:
1. Fetches all possible time slots for a court/date
2. Checks each slot against existing bookings  
3. Marks slots as available/booked with full booking details
4. Returns both filtered (available only) and complete (all slots) arrays
5. Frontend renders with appropriate colors and interactions

This creates a much more informative and user-friendly booking experience! üé®‚ú®
